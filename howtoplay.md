## Contents
- 108 cards as follows:
  - 19 Blue cards – 0 to 9
  - 19 Green cards – 0 to 9
  - 19 Red cards – 0 to 9
  - 19 Yellow cards – 0 to 9
  - 8 Reverse cards (2 each color)
  - 8 Skip cards (2 each color)
  - 8 Dare cards (2 each color)
  - 8 Wild Dare cards
- 4 Dare List cards (Family, Show-Off, Daredevil, and House Rules)

## Object of the Game
Be the first player to get rid of all of your cards in each round and score points for the cards your opponents are left holding. Points in rounds accumulate and the first player to reach 500 points wins the game.

## Setup
1. Before play begins, decide which one of the 4 Dare List cards you want to use in your game (only one per game). Place it face up in the center of the play area so everyone can see it.
2. Each player draws a card to determine the dealer; the player with the highest number deals (action cards count as zero).
3. The dealer shuffles the 108 playing cards and deals 7 cards to each player.
4. Place the remaining deck face down to form the Draw pile.
5. Turn over the top card of the Draw pile to start the Discard pile. If it's an action card, follow special instructions (see Functions of Action Cards).

Play starts with the player to the left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise.

## Let's Play
On your turn, you must match the top card on the Discard pile by either **number**, **color**, or **symbol**.

- If you have a matching card, play it on top of the Discard pile.
- If you don't have a matching card (or choose not to play one), draw the top card from the Draw pile.
  - If the drawn card is playable, you may play it immediately.
  - If not, your turn ends.

You may only play one card per turn.

## Functions of Action Cards
- **Reverse** – Reverses the direction of play.
- **Skip** – The next player in turn order loses their turn.
- **Dare** – The next player must choose: either **draw 2 cards** and skip their turn, **or perform a dare**.
- **Wild Dare** – The player who plays this card chooses the next color to be played. Then, the next player must choose: either **draw 2 cards** and skip their turn, **or perform a dare**.

(Note: There are no standard Draw Two or Wild/Wild Draw Four cards in UNO Dare! – the Dare and Wild Dare cards replace them.)

## Special UNO Dare Action Cards
When a Dare or Wild Dare card is played:
- The affected player chooses:
  - **Draw 2 cards** (and end turn), OR
  - **Perform a dare**.
- If they choose the dare, look at the **number** on the Dare/Wild Dare card just played (1-16). Find that number on the chosen Dare List card and perform the corresponding dare.
- All players can participate in making the dare fun (e.g., teasing, asking questions to test ongoing dares like accents or behaviors).
- If the player fails or refuses the dare, they must draw 2 cards instead.
- After completing (or failing) the dare, play continues normally.

Dares are meant to be FUN and family-friendly – agree on boundaries before playing.

If you use the House Rules Dare List card, fill in your own custom dares before the game starts.

## Going Out
When you have one card left, you must yell **"UNO!"** before playing your second-to-last card.

If you're caught not saying "UNO!" by another player before the next player begins their turn, you must draw 2 cards as a penalty.

When you play your last card:
- The round ends immediately.
- If your last card was a Dare or Wild Dare, the next player must still choose to draw 2 or perform the dare (using the number on your last card).

## Scoring
When a player goes out, they score points for all cards left in opponents' hands:
- Number cards (0-9): face value
- Reverse, Skip, Dare: 20 points each
- Wild Dare: 50 points each

Add up the points each round. Play multiple rounds until...

## Winning the Game
The first player to reach **500 points** wins!

## Alternative Scoring and Winning
Instead of playing to 500 points, you can play a set number of rounds or just play single rounds where the first to go out wins that hand. House rule it however you want.

## For Colorblind Players
Special graphic symbols have been added to each card to help identify the color(s). This allows players with any form of color blindness to easily play! Circle = Red, Diamond = Yellow, Triangle = Green, Square = Blue.
